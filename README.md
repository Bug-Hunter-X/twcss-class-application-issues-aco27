# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applying correctly, causing unexpected styling.  The issue is related to conflicting or missing styles. The solution involves carefully inspecting the CSS and resolving conflicting classes or ensuring the correct Tailwind directives are imported and configured.

## Bug Report

A simple `flex` container with two divs, one styled as `bg-red-500` and the other as `bg-blue-500`, shows the red div incorrectly styled as blue. This indicates a potential conflict or problem with the Tailwind configuration or class precedence.

## Solution
The solution might involve checking for:
* **Conflicting CSS:** Other CSS rules might override Tailwind's styles.
* **Incorrect class names:** Double check for typos or incorrect class names.
* **Plugin issues:** Ensure all necessary plugins are correctly installed and configured.
* **Order of classes:**  Ensure the correct order of classes to handle specificity.
* **Base styles:** Check if base styles are conflicting.
* **Tailwind config:** Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured and points to your CSS files.
